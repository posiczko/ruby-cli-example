## Features

## Screencasts

## Requirements

1. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

## Setup

To install _with_ security, run:

    # ðŸ’¡ Skip this line if you already have the public certificate installed.
    gem cert --add <(curl --compressed --location /gems.pem)
    gem install ruby_example --trust-policy HighSecurity

To install _without_ security, run:

    gem install ruby_example

You can also add the gem directly to your project:

    bundle add ruby_example

Once the gem is installed, you only need to require it:

    require "ruby_example"

## Usage

## Development

To contribute, run:

    git clone
    cd ruby_example
    bin/setup

* Globally rename `ruby_example` to `<project_name>` in project.
* Globally rename `RubyExample` to `<ProjectName>` in project.
* Rename `lib/ruby_example` and `lib/ruby_example.rb` to `lib/<project_name>` and 
  `lib/<project_name>.rb`
* Rename `spec/lib/ruby_example_spec.rb` to `spec/lib/<project_name>_spec.rb`.
* Rename `exe/ruby_example` to `exe/<project_name>`.
* Ensure to run `bundle update --bundler` followed by `bundle install`.
* Remove `.git` and reinitialize repo.
* Verify by running `bundle exec exe/<project_name>`
